Hey there! Welcome to *Voices of Middle-Earth*, a Lord of the Rings-inspired site I put together using React.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea is to let fans dive deeper into Tolkien's world. They can pick a Middle-Earth race, meet some iconic characters, and enjoy random quotes from them, all thanks to The One API.

## What’s It All About?

If you’re a fan of Lord of the Rings, this site is made for you! It gives you a way to explore different races from Middle-Earth, learn more about the characters tied to them, and enjoy some of their best quotes. Unfortunately, the API I’m pulling from only has quotes from the original trilogy, but it’s still a fun ride through Tolkien’s world.

## Features

- **Race Selection**: Pick your favorite Middle-Earth race and get ready to dive in.
- **Character Discovery**: On each race page, I’ve added a React component that grabs a random quote from a character, using The One API. The best part? The quote refreshes with the click of a button.
- **Adaptive Design**: Whether you're on your phone, tablet, or desktop, the site adjusts to look great on any screen.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: I used React for its flexibility and ability to create a smooth, interactive experience.
- **Node.js**: Handles backend tasks, making sure everything runs smoothly by fetching data from The One API.
- **HTML & CSS**: These build out the site’s structure and style, giving it that authentic Middle-Earth vibe.
- **JavaScript**: Powers all the interactive features that make the site fun to use.

It was a blast working with Material UI for the styling. It really helped give the site a polished, modern feel while keeping it easy to work with.
