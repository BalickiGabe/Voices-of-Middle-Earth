# Voices of Middle-Earth

Welcome to Voices of Middle-Earth, a Lord of the Rings themed website created using React.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This digital haven allows users to select different Middle-Earth races, delve into the characters associated with those races, and discover enchanting quotes from those characters, all fetched from The One API.

## Introduction

Voices of Middle-Earth is designed for fans of the Lord of the Rings series to explore the depth and breadth of Tolkien's universe. By navigating through the choices of races and characters, users can uncover quotes that resonate with the wisdom, humor, and bravery that define this legendary world. The public API that I was fetching from unfortunately only includes character quotes from the trillogy series.

## Features

## Technologies Used
