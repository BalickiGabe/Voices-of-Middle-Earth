# Voices of Middle-Earth

Welcome to Voices of Middle-Earth, a Lord of the Rings themed website created using React.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This digital haven allows users to select different Middle-Earth races, delve into the characters associated with those races, and discover enchanting quotes from those characters, all fetched from The One API.

## Introduction

Voices of Middle-Earth is designed for fans of the Lord of the Rings series to explore the depth and breadth of Tolkien's universe. By navigating through the choices of races and characters, users can uncover quotes that resonate with the wisdom, humor, and bravery that define this legendary world. The public API that I was fetching from unfortunately only includes character quotes from the trillogy series.

## Features

- **Race Selection**: Immerse yourself by choosing from a list of Middle-Earth races.
- **Character Discovery**: Each race page contains a React component that fetches and displays a random quote from a specified character using The One API, managing the quote's state with the useState hook and updating it upon a button click.
- **Adaptive Design**: Enjoy your journey on any device, thanks to a fully responsive design crafted for all screens.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Utilized for its powerful UI capabilities, allowing for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- **Node.js**: Provides the backend support, facilitating communication with The One API and handling application logic.
- **HTML & CSS**: The foundation of the website's structure and style, creating a visually appealing Middle-Earth environment.
- **JavaScript**: Empowers the interactive elements of the website, enhancing the user's journey through Middle-Earth.
